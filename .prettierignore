# TODO NEXT.JS MIGRATION:
# These are still used, but ignored for Prettier to avoid a big-bang reformatting.
# We can do such a reformatting later, or format them if/when we convert them to TypeScript:
src/utils/**/*.js
src/e2e/**/*.js
src/e2e/**/*.json
src/db/**/*.js

# TODO NEXT.JS MIGRATION:
# These files are remnants of our Express app:
src/app.js
src/appConstants.js
src/routes/
src/client/
src/views/
src/controllers/
src/middleware/

# These should be ignored anyway
coverage/
playwright-report/

# Ignore Glean generated files
src/telemetry/generated/
