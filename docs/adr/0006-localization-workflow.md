# L10N Workflow

- Status: Accepted
- Deciders: Monitor Team, L10N Team
- Date: 2023-07-11

Technical Story: [MNTOR-1795](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/MNTOR-1795)

## Context and Problem Statement

The current L10N workflow is a complex, multiple manual-step process to sync strings between two branches. This process is error-prone. Because of its lack of automation, it also often does not give the L10N team enough time to localize strings.

## Decision Drivers

- With the React refactor, this is a good time to revisit our processes, and determine what works the best for everyone.
  - This is also a chance to better align with other Mozilla projects.

## Considered Options

- Separate Repo / git Submodules (Relay)
- Separate Repo / Automated Syncing
- Leave as-is (Dedicated branch on repo)

## Decision Outcome

Separate Repo / Automated Syncing because is has the best experience (that process/security allows) for both developers and localizers.

Final process is an automated pull request workflow. The automation runs once a day, and creates a PR that needs to be manually reviewed.

_See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dRW85DNZpljmoS-U9KrZqV1nBDrT2g8WTpvTAM0HgY/edit?usp=sharing) for additional details on why complete automation is not currently possible._

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Separate Repo / git Submodules (Relay)

Instead of having Pontoon read and write translations from a separate branch, Relay uses a separate l10n repository, which is then imported as a git submodule in the main repository. [A GitHub action](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/.github/workflows/l10n-sync.yml) is used to automatically update the submodule revision once a day.

- Bad, git submodules are complex and have led to complex merge conflict issues in the past.
- Bad, The developer cannot add new English strings to the repository, they need to be added to the l10n repository.
  - This led the Relay team to create a [pendingTranslations.ftl](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/frontend/pendingTranslations.ftl) file to fill this gap. These strings are not tracked by L10N team and this files contents should constantly be removed/blank.
- Bad, Adding new strings to the l10n repository is a manual process (pull request).

### Separate Repo / Semi-automated Syncing

The proposal is to use a separate l10n repository instead of a separate branch, then use automation to sync only the relevant files between the two repositories instead of a git submodule.

_For additional sensitive considerations, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dRW85DNZpljmoS-U9KrZqV1nBDrT2g8WTpvTAM0HgY/edit?usp=sharing)_

- Good, There are no changes for development compared to the existing workflow.
- Good, This workflow doesn’t block developers from landing code in the main branch as part of code pull requests.
- Good, It also allows queuing multiple changes before exposing them for localization, since strings are exposed through a pull request, which is manually reviewed by the localization EPM.
- Good, There is no need to have a separate [localization review instance](https://monitor-localization.herokuapp.com/) for localizers.

### Leave as-is (Dedicated branch on repo)

Currently, all new translations are committed to the `localization` branch via Pontoon. To expose new English strings for localization, the updated English (en) FTL file needs to be added in this branch (manually).

- Good, The same branch is also used to publish a [special instance of Monitor](https://monitor-localization.herokuapp.com/) for localization for localizers to review.
- Bad, Pontoon commits every 10 minutes, and once per locale, polluting the repository’s history.
- Bad, Pontoon needs write access to the target branch, it doesn’t support a pull request workflow. (Must be excluded from branch protection rules).
- Good, Developers can land content and code without exposing it immediately for localization.
- Bad, Since the localization branch is used also to deploy a separate instance, it needs to periodically be synced with main to import new code.
- Bad, The sync between localization and main is completely manual, easy to forget, and can lead to errors (merge conflicts).
