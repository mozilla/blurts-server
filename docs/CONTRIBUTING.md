# How to contribute
We welcome and appreciate input, ideas, and code from contributors.

Because Firefox Monitor seeks to improve peoples' security behaviors, we do
not accept product changes lightly. For any user-facing change, please [submit
an issue for discussion
first](https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/issues/new). To keep our review
queue streamlined, if you submit your idea as a pull request with code changes,
we are likely to close it and ask you to submit an issue for discussion first.

Before you submit a new issue, please 
[search our existing issues](https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/issues)
to see if your idea is already in there. If it is, please add a +1 vote to the
existing issue. We check our [issues sorted by
upvotes](https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)
when we plan and prioritize our work.

We triage new, [un-labeled
issues](https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel)
every week. Once an issue has a label, we consider it triaged, and may not act
on it again until it is prioritized.

If you submit a PR for code changes, we will try to respond as quickly as we
can, but please be patient - especially if your change is large.

## Getting started with the code
blurts-server tries to follow a README-driven development practice, so our
instructions for installing, running, and testing code are in
[README.md](https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/blob/main/README.md).
