/*
ESBuild automatic code-splitting is disabled for the following reasons:
- As of this writing, ESBuild code-splitting is suggested to be experimental/WIP: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting
- There is a known bug with ESBuild that loads chunks out of order: https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/399
- The complete client bundle is currently only ~10kB transferred; splitting this down further is unlikely to result in significant load speed gains
- A ticket was completed (MNTOR-1171) to set up native/logical code-splitting depending on partial.
- see also https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/pull/2844
