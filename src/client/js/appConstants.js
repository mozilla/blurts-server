// PUBLIC APP CONSTANTS â€“ DO NOT ADD SECRETS HERE

/* During build-phase (npm start), ESBuild creates `buildConstants` as defined in esbuild.js, which include server env vars.
These are merged into client AppConstants and exported.

When app is run via `npm run dev`, ESBuild does not run and `buildConstants` is undefined.
For this case, we can add fallback vars to AppConstants if needed for testing. */
