          <h2>üîÑ Updating an Announcement</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>You can update:</strong> Fluent strings, publish label.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You cannot update:</strong> <code>announcement_id</code>{" "}
              or retroactive audience.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Thus, if you need to change the <code>announcement_id</code>,
                  delete the old announcement and create a new one. The images
                  and fluent strings correspond to the{" "}
                  <code>announcement_id</code> so you need to update that too.
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h2>üóë Deleting an Announcement</h2>
          <p>
            To remove an announcement: draft it in the DB or delete the record,
            and optionally clean up Fluent strings and image assets.
          </p>

          <h2>üí• Important Reminders</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each <code>announcement_id</code> must be globally unique.
            </li>
            <li>Ensure Fluent strings exist before deploying.</li>
            <li>
              Image paths must match the <code>announcement_id</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Audience filters are only evaluated once on user init.</li>
            <li>
              Before releasing an announcement, ensure it‚Äôs in a draft state
              first, review all the fields before publishing. This can only be
              done by an admin user.
            </li>
