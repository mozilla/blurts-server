## Password Tips

pwt-section-headline = Stronger Passwords = Better Protection
pwt-section-subhead = Your private information is only as safe as your passwords.
pwt-section-blurb =
  Your passwords protect more than your accounts. They protect every bit of personal information that resides in them. 
  And hackers rely on bad habits, like using the same password everywhere or using common phrases (p@ssw0rd, anyone?) so 
  that if they hack one account, they can hack many. Here’s how to better protect your accounts.

pwt-headline-1 = Use a different password for every account
pwt-summary-1 = 
  Reusing the same password everywhere leaves the door wide open for identity theft. 
  Anyone with that password can log in to all your accounts.

  Hackers use thousands of common passwords to try to guess yours. 
  The longer and more random your password is, the harder it will be to guess.
