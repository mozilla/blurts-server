// Theoretically, since the cron jobs run in Node, we don't need a bundler,
// since there are no HTTP requests we're trying to optimise. However, plain
// Node.js can't resolve module imports without file extensions (e.g.
// `"../db/tables/subscribers"`), so all import specifiers in *any* module that
// gets loaded by the cron jobs would need to use file extensions, which should
// also match those of the generated files (i.e. .js rather than .ts). Some of
// those modules are also used in our website, where this is bound to cause its
// own issues in Next.js. Thus, esbuild is a compromise that can resolve these
// import specifiers for us.
