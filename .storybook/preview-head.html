      The <AppDecorator> in preview.tsx should properly set the Inter font as
      the default font using next/font, but some components are rendered outside
      of the decorator by being appended to the <body> using a React Portal.
      Specifically, React Aria does this for modal elements like the <AppPicker>
      popover. Thus, this is a manual workaround to apply the Inter font there
      too. On the actual website, outside of Storybook, this should not be a
      problem, as the font is applied directly to the <body> using next/font in
      the root layout (src/app/layout.tsx).
